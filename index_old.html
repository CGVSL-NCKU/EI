<p class="my_justify move_rt"> 
Emergence refers to the unique human ability to aggregate information
from seemingly meaningless pieces, and to perceive a whole
that is meaningful. This special skill of humans can constitute an
effective scheme to tell humans and machines apart. This paper
presents a synthesis technique to generate images of 3D objects that
are detectable by humans, but difficult for an automatic algorithm
to recognize. The technique allows generating an infinite number
of images with emerging figures. Our algorithm is designed so that
locally the synthesized images divulge little useful information or
cues to assist any segmentation or recognition procedure. Therefore,
as we demonstrate, computer vision algorithms are incapable
of effectively processing such images. However, when a human observer
is presented with an emergence image, synthesized using an
object she is familiar with, the figure emerges when observed as a
whole. We can control the difficulty level of perceiving the emergence
effect through a limited set of parameters. A procedure that
synthesizes emergence images can be an effective tool for exploring
and understanding the factors affecting computer vision techniques.

<td align="justify" width="801px"> In many computer vision recognition or segmentation algorithms, 
the first stages comprise of multi-scale edge detection or other means of bottom-up region processing. 
At multiple-scales, we detect edges using standard Canny edge detector, and retain the ones that 
persists scales. Such curves are then linked together based on spatial proximity and curvature continuity. 
We observe that while on the original renderings the method successfully extracts the feature curves 
(right image in each box), on the emerging images the results can mostly be seen as noise. This indicates 
the difficulty that bottom-up algorithms face when detecting objects in the emergence images.
